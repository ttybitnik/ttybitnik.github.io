            <description>I have fond memories of the songs that would play during the soirée nights, casual gatherings with dear friends, and late-night pool dips during my college days at 1408. The melodic tunes and lyrics that once filled the air of that apartment now refresh my memory with those unforgettable times.</description>

            <description>The other day, I was reminded of my high school math teacher and how combinatorics was one of the few topics that interested me. The ability to envision a universe of possibilities within a given scenario was delightful. This morning, I combined that memory with an idea that has been occupying my mind lately—writing as an exercise of reflection and discovery. The lessons never end…
Combinatorial analysis exercise I I write to discover what I think.</description>

            <description>A person who is bothered talks about something that is annoying them. Some people who are bothered agree with them, while others who are bothered disagree. At a party, those who are not bothered are divided into two groups: those who are not bothered by the annoyance itself, but by the fact that there are so many bothered people bothering them; and those who are not bothered by anything at all, except for those who are not bothered by being bothered by so many bothers, which is known to cause them deep annoyance.</description>

<p>
In the end, the only people who decided not to go to the party were those who were not bothered at all, which certainly bothered a lot of people. Or at least that&#39;s how it seemed until they realized they weren&#39;t even invited.</p>
