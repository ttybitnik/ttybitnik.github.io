I think keyboards are fascinating devices, from design, technological, and linguistic perspectives. After all, a keyboard encompasses the tasks of (i) communicating in written language, (ii) operating and controlling the machine, and (iii) programming in computer language.</p>
<p>
Shortly after starting to use GNU Emacs, I found myself thinking extensively about the position of the keys on my keyboard. After researching a bit, the first information I found was about the different layouts, particularly <code class="verbatim">qwerty</code> and <code class="verbatim">dvorak</code>.</p>
<p>
<figure><img src="/images/blog/2023/image01.jpg"
         alt="Qwerty Layout"/><figcaption>
            <p>Qwerty Layout</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>
</p>
<p>
<figure><img src="/images/blog/2023/image02.jpg"
         alt="Dvorak Layout"/><figcaption>
            <p>Dvorak Layout</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>
</p>
<p>
At first, <code class="verbatim">dvorak</code>&#39;s proposal to distribute the keys according to letter frequency seemed sound to me. However, in a context of writing in different languages, the frequency and positions would have to change for each language. For that reason alone, I ended up deciding to stick with <code class="verbatim">qwerty</code> for now.</p>
<p>
Although the linguistic layout had an impact, I was more concerned with the position of the operational keys. For example, to me, it did not make sense for <kbd>CAPS</kbd> to be an easier-key-to-press than <kbd>ESC</kbd>. While reading the book <em>Mastering Emacs</em>,  I ended up discovering that the keyboards, at the time of GNU Emacs creation, were completely different in terms of modifiers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A much older joke is that Emacs stands for “Escape Meta Alt Control Shift.” (…) Back then, most Emacs keys were bound to a larger range of physical keyboard modifiers but when the keyboard maker (and the business that made the machines the keyboards were plugged into) went bust, Emacs had to change with the times. Instead of undoing the cornerstone of Emacs, the developers shuffled the keys around and made them work on normal, boring PC keyboards.</p>
<p>
— Mickey Petersen, in Mastering Emacs (2015)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
When I saw the photo of a Space Cadet used on the first Lisp machines, many traditional GNU bindings started to make even more sense, beyond their mnemonic aspect. For example, the fact that the current <kbd>Alt</kbd> key is called <kbd>M</kbd> (Meta).</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/images/blog/2023/image03.jpg" alt="Space Cadet">
  <figcaption>

  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Until this moment I was using the formidable <a href="https://github.com/kmonad/kmonad">KMonad</a> to swap the position of <kbd>CAPS</kbd> and <kbd>ESC</kbd>. I also spent some time customizing different layers to have a little more comfort even on a traditional keyboard design. One of KMonad&#39;s most powerful features is the ability to assign different commands to the same key based on the press type. For instance, I programmed my <kbd>SPC</kbd> key to act like <kbd>s</kbd> (Super) when pressed for more than 500ms without affecting its default functionality.</p>

However, even after customizing my entire keyboard using KMonad, I was still bothered by the physical position of the keys. Furthermore, the idea of ​​running a separate program to modify them did not appeal to me that much either. It was then that I discovered the X-Bows keyboard.</p>
<p>
<figure><img src="/images/blog/2023/image00.jpg"
         alt="X-Bows"/>
</figure>
</p>
<p>
The X-Bows has alternative keys for the thumb position, which was previously used primarily to press <kbd>SPC</kbd>. With these new keys, I can control the <kbd>C</kbd>, <kbd>M</kbd> and <kbd>S</kbd> modifiers only with that finger. I also have <kbd>DEL</kbd> and <kbd>RET</kbd> within easy reach. In short, the keyboard relieves combinations from the weakest finger, the little finger, to stronger fingers near the keyboard&#39;s center. That, along with the spacing and angulation, represents huge gains in comfort and performance.</p>
<p>
Aside from the ergonomic benefits, the ability to use thumb modifiers is also a boon when using GNU Emacs. Additionally, I found adapting to the keyboard to be quicker than expected. I will write more about that in an upcoming post on <strong>touch typing</strong>.</p>
<p>
In advance, I have been using the X-Bows for just over 3 months now. The only disadvantage I have noticed so far is that I have become so used to its design that it feels odd typing on other keyboards, especially on laptops. I have become somewhat dependent on it, which is not necessarily a bad thing. Ideally, it would be great to have laptops with the thumb cluster design one day. Or rather, if this design became a widespread standard.</p>
<p>
Until then, the most viable option has been carrying the X-Bows with me whenever necessary.</p>

It all started with my first laptop, an old Samsung RV415, hostname Vertov. It had stopped working for basic tasks, and while most people would simply buy a newer laptop, I could not just dispose of Vertov. He had been with me through most of my undergraduate studies and made it possible to play the soundtracks at 1408. He was my companion on my first international trip, and we cooked countless recipes together. Vertov had too much history to be just another tragedy of planned obsolescence.</p>
<div id="outline-container-headline-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="headline-1">
Hardware revival
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-1" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
The first idea that occurred to me was to make as many hardware improvements as possible. After an extensive research, I found some interesting components. I replaced the HHD with an SSD and doubled the amount of RAM with a new stick. However, opening the laptop completely to do a deep cleaning was somewhat challenging, and I had to struggle a bit with the plastic clips on the case. Nevertheless, everything went well, and I managed to change the thermal paste on the CPU as well. Even though I am used to doing this on my desktop computer, this adventure taught me a lot about the specifics of laptops.</p>
<p>
<figure><img src="/images/blog/2022/image00.jpg"
         alt="Vertov"/>
</figure>
</p>
<p>
In the midst of Vertov&#39;s revival procedure, I began to understand that the slowness he was experiencing was a much broader issue than it initially seemed. After all, why had he started to get slow? It might not necessarily be a hardware issue. Also, why was his processor soldered to the motherboard? This made any modification practically impossible. Even after the hardware improvements, Vertov still had some difficulty performing simultaneous tasks. It became evident to me that, in addition to the hardware, part of the slowness was due to the programs themselves, which were becoming increasingly heavier with features that were not even necessary for my use.</p>

<h2 id="headline-2">
GNU/Linux rediscovery
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-2" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
Coincidentally, in a conversation during this same period, a friend ended up mentioning that he ran Debian on his main computer—he had recently bought a desktop computer with the same specifications as mine. This mention brought back memories from high school when I and another friend installed Slackware. At the time, we had no idea all that it represented. Ultimately, I convinced myself to install &#34;Linux&#34; on Vertov, hoping to continue using it. The first choice, as a remembrance, was Slackware.</p>
<p>
<figure><img src="/images/blog/2022/image01.jpg"
         alt="Slackware"/>
</figure>
</p>
<p>
After installing Slackware, Vertov gained a new lease of life, and I was able to learn and discover countless things. Windows had been weighing him down, as its requirements grew over time, demanding stronger components. Since Windows seemed to be the only existing operating system option, Vertov would have become obsolete. I soon realized that being restricted to this proprietary operating system would always force me to dispose of my hardware, even though I was satisfied with its features. At that point, I began an intense learning process about the FOSS movement, GNU/Linux, and its entire philosophy, which gave me the freedom to have a free operating system. This was the start of my journey from being a regular user to becoming an advanced one.</p>

<h2 id="headline-3">
Digital autonomy
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
From that moment on, I began to actually control my computer and its programs and not the other way around. I started using Window Managers and even TTY as writing environments, which were noticeably lighter and free from distractions for my use. I discovered GNU Emacs and its incredible org-mode, which completely transformed the way I interact with computers and texts. I also started using RSS to organize and consume content instead of subjecting myself to arbitrary algorithms. Over time, I deepened my practical knowledge of UNIX/Linux, to the point where I started my own homelab. Now I was taking more than control over my hardware or software itself, I was starting to take control over my digital life as a whole.</p>
<p>
<div id="freedom-iframe-container" style="position: relative; padding-top: calc(60% + 100px); width: 100%;">
<iframe src="https://www.fsf.org/videos/escape-to-freedom/" scrolling="no" style="overflow: hidden; margin: 0; border: 0 none; display: block; position: absolute; width: 100%; height: 100%; top: 0;"></iframe>
</div>
<script>

window.onmessage = function (e) { if (e.data.hasOwnProperty("freedom-iframe-height")) { document.getElementById('freedom-iframe-container').style.height=`${e.data["freedom-iframe-height"]}px`;  document.getElementById('freedom-iframe-container').style["padding-top"]="unset";} };

</script>





</p>
<p>
All of this happened because, at a certain point, I refused to give up Vertov due to planned obsolescence. Not to mention the reuse of a perfectly functional equipment that would become e-waste. There is life beyond the <em>windows</em>.</p>
