It is a method where touch is relied upon instead of vision to locate the keys on the keyboard. In other words, a <strong>touch typist</strong> can type all the keys through muscle memory. This practice involves a series of concepts, which are summarized in the image below and further explained on the websites ahead.</p><figure><img src=/images/palimpsests/2023/image04.webp alt="Resting position of fingers on the home row"><figcaption><p>Resting position of fingers on the home row<sup class=footnote-reference><a id=footnote-reference-1 href=#footnote-1>1</a></sup></p></figcaption></figure><p>It is worth saying that besides the inherent challenges of transitioning to touch typing, I was also facing changes in keyboard layout (from <code class=verbatim>pt-br</code> to <code class=verbatim>us</code>), design (from conventional to thumb cluster), and language (from Portuguese to English) due to the anglophone aspect of the exercises.</p><p>After testing some options, I decided to use these two websites for learning it:</p><dl><dt><a href=https://www.typing.com>typing.com</a></dt><dd>For theoretical content and basic exercises.</dd><dt><a href=https://www.keybr.com/>keybr.com</a></dt><dd>For more advanced exercises, adapted to my progress level.</dd></dl><p>I practiced <strong>30 minutes a day for a month</strong>. 15 minutes on <code class=verbatim>typing.com</code> followed by 15 minutes on <code class=verbatim>keybr.com</code>. Additionally, I made a conscious effort to not abandon the touch typing method whenever I needed to use the computer for day-to-day tasks. <em>Yes, the beginning was quite difficult.</em></p><p>Here are some <a href=https://www.keybr.com/profile/q43lvyf>statistics</a> from <code class=verbatim>keybr.com</code> about my learning process. I also wrote down my daily impressions in my journal, which I recapped by week at the end of this text.</p><p>All in all, after a month of this routine, I went from 36 words per minute with the visual method to an average of <strong>85 words per minute</strong> with touch typing. In addition to benefits in speed and muscle memory, typing properly also provided me with much more comfort. Certainly, it is a skill that I wish I had developed sooner and that is absolutely welcome in our times.</p><p>After this learning period, I started using <a href=https://monkeytype.com/>monkeytype.com</a> for maintenance and warming up whenever I feel the need.</p><div id=outline-container-headline-1 class=outline-2><h2 id=headline-1>Week 1</h2><div id=outline-text-headline-1 class=outline-text-2><p>Certainly, this has been the hardest week. The desire to revert to typing the old way is strong. Basic tasks take a lot of time, to the point where the computer becomes practically unusable.</p><p>After a few days, with persistent efforts to position the fingers correctly, simple tasks became manageable.</p><p>From the middle to the end of this week, I noticed some signs of smoothness.</p><p>Practices have already begun to involve capitalization and a broader set of sequences.</p></div></div><div id=outline-container-headline-2 class=outline-2><h2 id=headline-2>Week 2</h2><div id=outline-text-headline-2 class=outline-text-2><p>Typing speed is increasing.
