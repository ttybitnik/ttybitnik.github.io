After all, a keyboard encompasses the tasks of (i) communicating in written language, (ii) operating and controlling the machine, and (iii) programming in computer language.</p><p>Shortly after starting to use GNU Emacs, I found myself thinking extensively about the position of the keys on my keyboard. After researching a bit, the first information I found was about the different layouts, particularly <code class=verbatim>qwerty</code> and <code class=verbatim>dvorak</code>.</p><p><figure><img src=/images/blog/2023/image01.jpg alt="Qwerty Layout"><figcaption><p>Qwerty Layout</p></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=/images/blog/2023/image02.jpg alt="Dvorak Layout"><figcaption><p>Dvorak Layout</p></figcaption></figure></p><p>At first, <code class=verbatim>dvorak</code>'s proposal to distribute the keys according to letter frequency seemed sound to me. However, in a context of writing in different languages, the frequency and positions would have to change for each language. For that reason alone, I ended up deciding to stick with <code class=verbatim>qwerty</code> for now.</p><p>Although the linguistic layout had an impact, I was more concerned with the position of the operational keys. For example, to me, it did not make sense for <kbd>CAPS</kbd> to be an easier-key-to-press than <kbd>ESC</kbd>. While reading the book <code class=verbatim>Mastering Emacs</code>, I ended up discovering that the keyboards at the time of GNU Emacs creation were completely different in terms of modifiers.</p><blockquote><p>A much older joke is that Emacs stands for ‚ÄúEscape Meta Alt Control Shift.‚Äù (‚Ä¶) Back then, most Emacs keys were bound to a larger range of physical keyboard modifiers but when the keyboard maker (and the business that made the machines the keyboards were plugged into) went bust, Emacs had to change with the times. Instead of undoing the cornerstone of Emacs, the developers shuffled the keys around and made them work on normal, boring PC keyboards.</p><p>‚Äî Mickey Petersen, in Mastering Emacs (2015)</p></blockquote><p>When I saw the photo of a Space Cadet used on the first Lisp machines, many traditional GNU bindings started to make even more sense, beyond their mnemonic aspect. For example, the fact that the current <kbd>Alt</kbd> key is called <kbd>M</kbd> (Meta).</p><figure><img src=/images/blog/2023/image03.jpg alt="Space Cadet"><figcaption><p>Space Cadet used with the LM-2<sup class=footnote-reference><a id=footnote-reference-1 href=#footnote-1>1</a></sup></p></figcaption></figure><p>Until this moment I was using the formidable <a href=https://github.com/kmonad/kmonad>KMonad</a> to swap the position of <kbd>CAPS</kbd> and <kbd>ESC</kbd>. I also spent some time customizing different layers to have a little more comfort even on a traditional keyboard design. One of KMonad's most powerful features is the ability to assign different commands to the same key based on the press type. For instance, I programmed my <kbd>SPC</kbd> key to act like <kbd>s</kbd> (Super) when pressed for more than 500ms without affecting its default functionality.</p><div class="src src-text"><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-text data-lang=text><span class=line><span class=ln> 1</span><span class=cl>  #| --------------------------------------------------------------------

Furthermore, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãrunning a separate program to modify them did not appeal to me that much either. It was then that I discovered the X-Bows keyboard.</p><p><figure><img src=/images/blog/2023/image00.jpg alt=X-Bows><figcaption><p>X-Bows</p></figcaption></figure></p><p>The X-Bows has alternative keys for the thumb position, which was previously used primarily to press the <kbd>SPC</kbd> key. With these new keys, I can control the <kbd>C</kbd>, <kbd>M</kbd> and <kbd>S</kbd> modifiers only with that finger. I also have <kbd>DEL</kbd> and <kbd>RET</kbd> within easy reach. In short, the keyboard relieves combinations from the weakest finger, the little finger, to stronger fingers near the keyboard's center. That, along with the spacing and angulation, represents huge gains in comfort and performance.</p><p>Aside from the ergonomic benefits, the ability to use thumb modifiers is also a boon when using GNU Emacs. Additionally, I found adapting to the keyboard to be quicker than expected. I will write more about that in an upcoming post on <code class=verbatim>touch typing</code>.</p><p>Beforehand, I have been using the X-Bows for just over 3 months now, and the only disadvantage I have noticed so far is that I have become so used to its design that it feels odd to type on other keyboards, especially on laptops. I have become somewhat dependent on it, which is not necessarily a bad thing. Ideally, it would be great to have laptops with the thumb cluster design one day. Or rather, if this design became a widespread standard.</p><p>Until then, the most viable option has been bringing the X-Bows with me whenever necessary.</p><div class=footnotes><hr class=footnotes-separatator><div class=footnote-definitions><div class=footnote-definition><sup id=footnote-1><a href=#footnote-reference-1>1</a></sup><div class=footnote-body><p>Retro-Computing Society of Rhode Island, via <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-cadet_keyboard#/media/File:Space-cadet.jpg>Wikimedia Commons</a></p></div></div></div></div></content><p class=fleuron>‚àó ‚àó ‚àó</p><p class=byline><time datetime=2023-07-11 pubdate>2023-07-11</time></p><p><a class=blog-tags href=https://eternodevir.com/categories/notes/><code class=verbatim>notes</code></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
